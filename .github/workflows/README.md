# GitHub Actions Workflows Configuration

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows implemented for the SFM Graph Service project.

## Workflow Overview

The project includes 8 comprehensive workflows designed to ensure code quality, security, performance, and documentation consistency:

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
**Purpose**: Core build and test validation
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version testing (3.8-3.12)
- Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- Code complexity analysis with Radon
- Build validation and package testing
- Coverage reporting with artifacts

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must pass
- Build must complete successfully
- Coverage reports generated

### 2. Code Quality Checks (`code-quality.yml`)
**Purpose**: Maintain code quality standards
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Key Features**:
- Pylint analysis with minimum score requirement (8.0)
- Flake8 linting with custom configuration
- MyPy type checking (gradual adoption: ≤50 errors)
- Black and isort formatting validation
- Pre-commit hooks execution

**Quality Gates**:
- Pylint score ≥ 8.0
- MyPy errors ≤ 50
- All formatting checks pass

### 3. Performance Testing (`performance.yml`)
**Purpose**: Monitor and validate system performance
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Daily schedule
**Key Features**:
- SFMGraph performance benchmarks
- Memory profiling with memray
- Lookup speed benchmarks
- Concurrent operations testing
- Performance regression detection

**Quality Gates**:
- Performance benchmarks complete
- Memory usage within acceptable limits
- Concurrent operations pass

### 4. Security Validation (`security.yml`)
**Purpose**: Ensure security best practices
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Daily schedule
**Key Features**:
- Security validation test execution
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static security analysis with Bandit and Semgrep
- Custom security pattern detection
- Vulnerability assessment reporting

**Quality Gates**:
- Security tests pass
- No high-severity vulnerabilities
- Static analysis clean

### 5. Documentation Validation (`documentation.yml`)
**Purpose**: Maintain documentation quality
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Key Features**:
- Docstring validation with pydocstyle
- Markdown linting and link checking
- API documentation consistency
- Sphinx documentation building
- Documentation coverage analysis

**Quality Gates**:
- Docstring validation passes
- Markdown files valid
- Documentation builds successfully

### 7. Test Examples (`test-examples.yml`)
**Purpose**: Validate repository examples and demonstrations
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Manual dispatch
**Key Features**:
- Automated testing of all repository examples
- Output verification and pattern matching
- Edge case testing and error scenario validation
- Memory constraint testing
- Comprehensive reporting with debugging artifacts

**Quality Gates**:
- All examples execute successfully
- Expected outputs match patterns
- Memory usage within limits

### 8. Pylint (`pylint.yml`)
**Purpose**: Legacy Pylint validation (enhanced version)
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Key Features**:
- Multi-Python version Pylint analysis
- Score reporting and artifact generation
- Enhanced error reporting

### 9. Test Suite (`pytest.yml`)
**Purpose**: Legacy test execution (enhanced version)
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- Coverage reporting with artifacts
- Parallel test execution
- Dependency caching
