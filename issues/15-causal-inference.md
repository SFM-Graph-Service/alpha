# Causal Inference and Policy Impact Assessment Implementation

## Issue Summary
Implement advanced causal identification methods and policy impact assessment tools for the SFM framework to isolate causal effects of policy interventions and analyze network-based causal relationships.

## Scope
This issue covers the implementation of advanced causal identification techniques and network-based causal analysis methods.

## Requirements

### 1. Advanced Causal Identification
- **Instrumental Variables (IV) estimation** to isolate causal effects of policy interventions
- **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)** for analyzing threshold-based policy effects
- **Difference-in-differences** estimation for comparative policy analysis across regions/sectors
- **Propensity Score Matching** to create control groups for policy evaluation

### 2. Network-Based Causal Analysis
- **Spatial econometrics** to capture spillover effects through network structure
- **Peer effects models** to analyze how institutional changes propagate through the network
- **Network instrumental variables** to identify causal effects in interconnected systems

## Proposed Implementation
Create a new module `core/causal_inference.py` with the following classes:
- `InstrumentalVariablesAnalyzer`
- `RegressionDiscontinuityAnalyzer`
- `DifferenceInDifferencesAnalyzer`
- `PropensityScoreAnalyzer`
- `SpatialEconometricsAnalyzer`
- `NetworkIVAnalyzer`

## Dependencies
- linearmodels
- econml
- scikit-learn
- pysal
- spreg
- networkx (already integrated)

## Priority
High

## Additional Notes
- Enhance existing policy impact analysis functionality
- Integrate with current network structure for spillover analysis
- Provide clear interfaces for policy evaluation workflows
- Add validation methods for causal assumptions
