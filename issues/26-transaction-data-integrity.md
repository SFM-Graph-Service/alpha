# Transaction Management and Data Integrity

## Issue Summary
The SFM framework lacks proper transaction management, rollback capabilities, and data integrity guarantees. This creates significant risks for data corruption, especially in concurrent usage scenarios and complex operations.

## Critical Missing Features

### 1. Transaction Management Infrastructure
**Location**: [`core/sfm_service.py`](core/sfm_service.py ) - `transaction()` method
**Current State**: Placeholder implementation only
```python
@contextmanager
def transaction(self):
    """Note: This is a placeholder for future implementation."""
    try:
        yield self
    except Exception:
        logger.error("Transaction failed, would rollback if supported")
        raise
```
**Problem**: No actual transaction semantics, no rollback capability

### 2. ACID Transaction Support Missing
**Problems**:
- **Atomicity**: No guarantee that complex operations complete fully or not at all
- **Consistency**: No validation that graph remains in valid state
- **Isolation**: No protection against concurrent modification conflicts
- **Durability**: No guarantee that committed changes persist

### 3. Data Corruption Risks
**Scenarios**:
- Bulk operations fail midway, leaving partial updates
- Concurrent users modify same entities simultaneously
- Network failures during persistence operations
- Memory exhaustion during large graph operations

## Current Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Operations
1. **Bulk entity creation** - Can leave partial data if interrupted
2. **Complex relationship updates** - May create orphaned references
3. **Graph serialization/deserialization** - Corruption during I/O failures
4. **Concurrent API access** - Race conditions in shared state

### Data Integrity Gaps
- No referential integrity checking between entities
- No validation of relationship consistency
- No detection of circular dependencies in critical paths
- No backup/recovery mechanisms for corrupted data

## Proposed Transaction Implementation

### Phase 1 - Basic Transaction Support
```python
class TransactionManager:
    def __init__(self, graph: SFMGraph):
        self.graph = graph
        self._transaction_log: List[Operation] = []
        self._snapshots: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    
    @contextmanager
    def transaction(self):
        """Implement proper transaction semantics."""
        transaction_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self._begin_transaction(transaction_id)
        
        try:
            yield self
            self._commit_transaction(transaction_id)
        except Exception as e:
            self._rollback_transaction(transaction_id)
            raise TransactionError(f"Transaction failed: {e}") from e
        finally:
            self._cleanup_transaction(transaction_id)
```

### Phase 2 - Advanced Transaction Features
```python
class SFMService:
    def __init__(self):
        self._transaction_manager = TransactionManager(self.graph)
        self._lock_manager = LockManager()
    
    @transactional
    def bulk_create_actors(self, requests: List[CreateActorRequest]) -> List[NodeResponse]:
        """Bulk operation with transaction safety."""
        with self._transaction_manager.transaction():
            results = []
            for request in requests:
                # Each operation logged for potential rollback
                actor = self._create_actor_internal(request)
                results.append(actor)
            return results
```

### Phase 3 - Concurrent Access Control
```python
class LockManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self._entity_locks: Dict[uuid.UUID, threading.RLock] = {}
        self._global_lock = threading.RLock()
    
    @contextmanager
    def lock_entity(self, entity_id: uuid.UUID, mode: str = "read"):
        """Provide entity-level locking for concurrent access."""
        pass
```

## Data Integrity Enhancements

### 1. Referential Integrity Checking
```python
class IntegrityChecker:
    def validate_relationship(self, relationship: Relationship) -> bool:
        """Ensure both endpoints exist before creating relationship."""
        source_exists = self.graph.get_node(relationship.source_id) is not None
        target_exists = self.graph.get_node(relationship.target_id) is not None
        return source_exists and target_exists
    
    def validate_graph_consistency(self) -> List[IntegrityViolation]:
        """Check entire graph for consistency issues."""
        violations = []
        # Check for orphaned relationships
        # Validate entity type constraints
        # Verify temporal consistency
        return violations
```

### 2. Operation Logging and Audit Trail
```python
class OperationLogger:
    def log_operation(self, operation: Operation, user_id: str, timestamp: datetime):
        """Log all graph modifications for audit and recovery."""
        pass
    
    def get_operation_history(self, entity_id: uuid.UUID) -> List[Operation]:
        """Retrieve modification history for entity."""
        pass
```

## Recovery and Backup Integration

### Backup Strategy Enhancement
```python
class BackupManager:
    def create_transaction_checkpoint(self, graph: SFMGraph) -> str:
        """Create point-in-time backup before major operations."""
        pass
    
    def restore_from_checkpoint(self, checkpoint_id: str) -> SFMGraph:
        """Restore graph state from checkpoint."""
        pass
```

### Auto-Recovery Mechanisms
```python
class RecoveryManager:
    def detect_corruption(self, graph: SFMGraph) -> List[CorruptionReport]:
        """Scan graph for corruption indicators."""
        pass
    
    def attempt_auto_repair(self, corruption: CorruptionReport) -> bool:
        """Try to automatically fix detected issues."""
        pass
```
