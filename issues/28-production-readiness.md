# Production Readiness and Deployment Blockers

## Issue Summary
Multiple critical gaps prevent the SFM framework from being production-ready. This meta-issue consolidates deployment blockers, infrastructure requirements, and production hardening needs across all core modules.

## Critical Deployment Blockers

### 1. Security Infrastructure Missing
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **BLOCKING**
- **Authentication/Authorization**: No user management system
- **API Security**: No API key management, rate limiting basic only
- **Input Validation**: Insufficient protection against injection attacks
- **Audit Logging**: No comprehensive audit trail for compliance

### 2. Monitoring and Observability Gaps
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **BLOCKING**
- **Health Monitoring**: Basic health check only, no detailed metrics
- **Performance Monitoring**: No APM integration, no request tracing
- **Error Tracking**: Basic logging only, no centralized error aggregation
- **Business Metrics**: No SFM-specific analytics and insights

### 3. Data Persistence and Backup
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **BLOCKING**
- **Database Integration**: File-based storage only, no production database
- **Backup Strategy**: Manual backups only, no automated scheduling
- **Disaster Recovery**: No recovery procedures or testing
- **Data Migration**: No versioning or migration tools

### 4. Scalability and Performance
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **BLOCKING**  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Single-instance only, no load balancing
- **Caching Strategy**: Basic in-memory only, no distributed caching
- **Background Processing**: No async job queue for heavy operations
- **Resource Limits**: No resource consumption controls

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Minimum Production Environment
```yaml
# Required Infrastructure Components

  primary: PostgreSQL 13+ or Neo4j 4.4+
  backup: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

security:
  auth: OAuth2/JWT authentication provider
  secrets: Vault or similar secret management
  
deployment:
  orchestration: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm

```

### Resource Requirements (Estimated)
```yaml
minimum_production:

```

## Security Hardening Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] API key management with expiration
- [ ] Session management and timeout
- [ ] OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encryption at rest for all persistent data
- [ ] Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- [ ] Sensitive data masking in logs
- [ ] Personal data handling (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] Data retention and purging policies

### Network Security
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] IP whitelisting capabilities
- [ ] VPN/private network access
- [ ] Certificate management automation

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection protection
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection  
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Input size and rate limiting

## Monitoring and Alerting Strategy

### Application Metrics
```python
# Required metrics to implement
class ProductionMetrics:
    # Performance metrics
    request_duration = Histogram('sfm_request_duration_seconds')
    request_count = Counter('sfm_requests_total')
    error_rate = Counter('sfm_errors_total')
    
    # Business metrics
    graph_size = Gauge('sfm_graph_nodes_total')
    query_complexity = Histogram('sfm_query_complexity')
    user_sessions = Gauge('sfm_active_users')
    
    # Resource metrics
    memory_usage = Gauge('sfm_memory_usage_bytes')
    cache_hit_rate = Gauge('sfm_cache_hit_rate')
    database_connections = Gauge('sfm_db_connections')
```

### Alert Conditions
- Response time >5 seconds for 95th percentile
- Error rate >1% over 5-minute window  
- Memory usage >80% of available
- Database connection pool >90% utilized
- Cache hit rate <70%
- Failed authentication attempts >100/hour

## Production Configuration Management

### Environment Configuration
```python
# Production configuration structure
class ProductionConfig:
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL: str
    DATABASE_POOL_SIZE: int = 20
    DATABASE_TIMEOUT: int = 30
    
    # Cache
    REDIS_URL: str
    CACHE_TTL: int = 3600
    
    # Security
    SECRET_KEY: str
    JWT_SECRET: str
    ENCRYPTION_KEY: str
    
    # Performance
    MAX_GRAPH_SIZE: int = 100000
    QUERY_TIMEOUT: int = 30
    WORKER_PROCESSES: int = 4
    
    # Monitoring
    APM_SERVICE_NAME: str = "sfm-api"
    LOG_LEVEL: str = "INFO"
    METRICS_ENABLED: bool = True
```

### Deployment Automation
```dockerfile
# Production Dockerfile improvements needed
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Security: Non-root user
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos '' sfm
USER sfm

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1

# Resource limits
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV WORKERS=4
ENV MAX_MEMORY="2g"

# Start with production WSGI server
CMD ["gunicorn", "--workers", "$WORKERS", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "api.sfm_api:app"]
```
