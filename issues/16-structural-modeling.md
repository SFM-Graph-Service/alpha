# Structural Modeling and Forecasting Implementation

## Issue Summary
Implement structural equation models and discrete choice methods for the SFM framework to model complex interdependencies and analyze policy adoption decisions.

## Scope
This issue covers the implementation of structural equation models (SEM) and discrete choice/limited dependent variable methods.

## Requirements

### 1. Structural Equation Models (SEM)
- **Simultaneous equation systems** to model complex interdependencies between actors, institutions, and resources
- **Path analysis** to quantify indirect effects through network pathways
- **Confirmatory factor analysis** to validate institutional layer classifications

### 2. Discrete Choice and Limited Dependent Variables
- **Multinomial logit models** for analyzing policy adoption decisions across multiple actors
- **Ordered probit/logit** for modeling ordinal outcomes (e.g., policy effectiveness ratings)
- **Count data models** (Poisson, Negative Binomial) for analyzing frequency of institutional interactions

## Proposed Implementation
Create a new module `core/structural_modeling.py` with the following classes:
- `SimultaneousEquationAnalyzer`
- `PathAnalysisEngine`
- `ConfirmatoryFactorAnalyzer`
- `MultinomialLogitAnalyzer`
- `OrderedChoiceAnalyzer`
- `CountDataAnalyzer`

## Dependencies
- statsmodels
- semopy
- factor_analyzer
- scipy
- scikit-learn

## Priority
Medium

## Additional Notes
- Formalize relationships between actors, institutions, and resources
- Integrate with existing graph structure for path analysis
- Provide model validation and goodness-of-fit testing
- Support both frequentist and Bayesian approaches where applicable
