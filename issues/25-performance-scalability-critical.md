# Performance and Scalability Critical Issues

## Issue Summary
The SFM framework has significant performance bottlenecks and scalability limitations that prevent deployment with large datasets. Memory management, caching strategies, and algorithmic efficiency need immediate attention.

## Critical Performance Issues

### 1. Incomplete Lazy Loading Infrastructure
**Location**: [`core/graph.py`](core/graph.py ) - `SFMGraph` class
**Problem**: Lazy loading methods are stub implementations
```python
def _find_node_by_id_with_lazy_loading(self, node_id: uuid.UUID) -> Optional[Node]:
    # Currently just sets flags, no actual lazy loading logic
    pass
```
**Impact**: Cannot handle large graphs, memory exhaustion with 10,000+ nodes

### 2. Inefficient Memory Management
**Problem**: All nodes loaded in memory simultaneously
- No node eviction strategies
- No memory-aware caching limits
- Missing cache hit/miss metrics
**Impact**: Memory usage grows linearly with graph size

### 3. Suboptimal Lookup Algorithms
**Problem**: Some operations still use O(n) complexity
- Relationship lookups could be optimized
- Missing indices for common query patterns
**Impact**: Query performance degrades with graph size

### 4. Missing Caching Strategies
**Problem**: Limited caching implementation
- Relationship cache has basic LRU but no advanced strategies
- No query result caching
- No pre-computed metric caching
**Impact**: Repeated queries perform unnecessary recalculations

## Scalability Limitations

### Current Limits (Estimated)
- **Nodes**: ~10,000 (before memory issues)
- **Relationships**: ~50,000 (before performance degradation)
- **Concurrent Users**: 1 (no concurrent access control)
- **Query Response Time**: >10s for complex analysis on large graphs

### Production Requirements
- **Nodes**: 100,000+ (for real-world SFM models)
- **Relationships**: 1,000,000+ (complex policy networks)
- **Concurrent Users**: 50+ (multi-user analysis)
- **Query Response Time**: <2s for most operations

## Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1 - Memory Management (Critical)
```python
# Implement in SFMGraph
class SFMGraph:
    def __init__(self, max_memory_mb: int = 1000):
        self._max_memory = max_memory_mb
        self._memory_monitor = MemoryMonitor()
        self._eviction_strategy = LRUEvictionStrategy()
    
    def _check_memory_usage(self):
        if self._memory_monitor.usage_mb > self._max_memory:
            self._eviction_strategy.evict_nodes(self)
```

### Phase 2 - Advanced Caching (High Priority)
```python
# Multi-level caching strategy
class QueryCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self._node_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=10000, ttl=3600)
        self._relationship_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=50000)
        self._metrics_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=1800)
```

### Phase 3 - Lazy Loading Implementation (High Priority)
```python
def _find_node_by_id_with_lazy_loading(self, node_id: uuid.UUID) -> Optional[Node]:
    # Check memory cache first
    node = self._node_index.get(node_id)
    if node:
        return node
    
    # Load from storage if lazy loading enabled
    if self._lazy_loading_enabled and self._node_loader:
        node = self._node_loader(node_id)
        if node:
            self._add_to_cache(node)
        return node
    
    return None
```

### Phase 4 - Algorithmic Optimizations (Medium Priority)
- Pre-compute and cache common centrality measures
- Implement incremental graph updates
- Add graph partitioning for distributed processing

## Performance Testing Requirements

### Benchmarks to Implement
1. **Memory Usage**: Track memory consumption vs. graph size
2. **Query Performance**: Response times for common operations
3. **Cache Efficiency**: Hit/miss ratios for different cache strategies
4. **Concurrent Access**: Performance under multiple users
5. **Large Graph Limits**: Breaking points for different operations

### Test Scenarios
- **Small Graph**: 100 nodes, 500 relationships
- **Medium Graph**: 1,000 nodes, 5,000 relationships  
- **Large Graph**: 10,000 nodes, 50,000 relationships
- **Stress Test**: 100,000 nodes, 1,000,000 relationships

## Memory Profile Requirements
```python
# Add memory monitoring
@memory_profiler
def analyze_policy_impact(self, policy_id: uuid.UUID) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Track memory usage during analysis
    pass
```

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement memory monitoring** and limits
2. **Complete lazy loading** infrastructure  
3. **Add performance benchmarks** to CI pipeline
4. **Create memory-aware caching** strategies
5. **Optimize critical query paths** for O(log n) complexity

- [ ] Handle 50,000+ nodes without memory issues
- [ ] Query response times <5s for 95% of operations
- [ ] Memory usage grows sub-linearly with graph size
