# Econometric Integration and Core Implementation

## Issue Summary
Create the core econometric analysis framework that integrates with the existing SFM architecture and provides a unified interface for all econometric methods.

## Scope
This issue covers the implementation of the main `EconometricAnalyzer` class and integration points with the existing SFM framework.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Econometric Framework
- **EconometricAnalyzer** main class that integrates with `SFMGraph`
- **Data extraction and preparation** methods for temporal and cross-sectional analysis
- **Model selection and validation** framework
- **Results interpretation and visualization** tools

### 2. Integration Points
- Extract temporal data from SFM graph structure
- Interface with existing policy impact analysis methods
- Enhance current network analysis with econometric rigor
- Provide econometric validation for existing SFM relationships

## Proposed Implementation
```python
class EconometricAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, sfm_graph: SFMGraph):
        self.sfm_graph = sfm_graph
        self.time_series_data = self._extract_temporal_data()
    
    def estimate_policy_impact_iv(self, policy_id: str, instrument_vars: List[str]):
        """IV estimation for causal policy impact"""
        pass
    
    def analyze_network_spillovers(self, spatial_weight_matrix: np.ndarray):
        """Spatial econometric analysis of network effects"""
        pass
    
    def _extract_temporal_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Extract time series data from SFM graph"""
        pass
```

Create a new module `core/econometric_analyzer.py` with supporting utilities in `core/econometric_utils.py`.

## Dependencies
- statsmodels (core econometric functionality)
- linearmodels (advanced panel data and IV methods)
- pysal (spatial econometric analysis)
- arch (time series and volatility modeling)
- scikit-learn (machine learning integration)
- networkx (already integrated)
- pandas (data manipulation)
- numpy (numerical computing)

## Priority
High

## Additional Notes
- Serves as the foundation for all other econometric analysis issues
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing SFM functionality
- Provide clear documentation and examples for users
- Include comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
- Consider performance implications for large graphs
