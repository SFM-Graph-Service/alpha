# Time Series and Panel Data Analysis Implementation

## Issue Summary
Implement advanced time series and panel data analysis capabilities for the SFM framework to analyze how institutional changes affect economic outcomes over time and capture dynamic relationships between SFM entities.

## Scope
This issue covers the implementation of dynamic panel data models and temporal dynamics enhancement tools.

## Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Panel Data Models
- **Arellano-Bond/Blundell-Bond estimators** for analyzing how institutional changes affect economic outcomes over time
- **Vector Autoregression (VAR) models** to capture dynamic relationships between multiple SFM entities  
- **Cointegration analysis** to identify long-term equilibrium relationships between policy variables and outcomes

### 2. Temporal Dynamics Enhancement
- **State-space models** to better capture the evolution of the current temporal dynamics framework
- **Kalman filtering** for real-time updating of policy impact estimates
- **Regime-switching models** to handle structural breaks in institutional relationships

## Proposed Implementation
Create a new module `core/time_series_analysis.py` with the following classes:
- `DynamicPanelAnalyzer`
- `VARModelAnalyzer` 
- `CointegrationAnalyzer`
- `StateSpaceAnalyzer`
- `KalmanFilterAnalyzer`
- `RegimeSwitchingAnalyzer`

## Dependencies
- statsmodels
- arch
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas

## Priority
Medium

## Additional Notes
- Integrate with existing temporal dynamics framework in SFM
- Ensure compatibility with current graph structure
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all time series methods
