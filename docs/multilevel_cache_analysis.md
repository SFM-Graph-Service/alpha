# MultiLevelCache.get Method Analysis

## Issue Summary
The `advanced_caching.get` method was reported as a stub method in the core analysis report, but investigation revealed it is actually fully implemented and working correctly.

## Root Cause of Misclassification

The analysis script incorrectly flagged the method as a stub due to pattern matching that was too simplistic. The method ends with `return None` as part of its normal operation:

```python
def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
    """Get value with cache level promotion."""
    with self._lock:
        for i, cache in enumerate(self._levels):
            value = cache.get(key)
            if value is not None:
                # Promote to higher levels
                for j in range(i):
                    self._levels[j].set(key, value)
                return value
        return None  # <- This line triggered the false positive
```

The analysis script matched the pattern `return\s+None\s*$` and incorrectly classified this as a stub method. However, returning `None` when a cache key is not found is the correct and expected behavior for a cache get operation.

## Actual Implementation

The `MultiLevelCache.get` method is fully implemented with the following features:

1. **Cache Level Search**: Iterates through cache levels in priority order
2. **Cache Promotion**: When a value is found in a lower-priority cache, promotes it to all higher-priority caches
3. **Thread Safety**: Uses proper locking with `threading.RLock()`
4. **Proper Return Behavior**: Returns the cached value or `None` if not found
5. **Performance Optimization**: Cache promotion improves subsequent access times

## File Path Discrepancy

The report claimed the file was at `core/advanced_caching.py`, but the actual file is at `infrastructure/advanced_caching.py`. This suggests the analysis script had path resolution issues.

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive tests have been added in `/tests/test_multilevel_cache_get.py` that verify:

- Correct handling of non-existent keys
- Cache level promotion functionality  
- Thread safety
- Multiple cache level support
- Performance characteristics
- Method signature and return types

## Conclusion

The `advanced_caching.get` method at line 423 in `infrastructure/advanced_caching.py` is **NOT a stub method**. It is a fully implemented, working method that provides sophisticated multi-level caching with automatic promotion. No implementation is required.

## Recommendations for Future Analysis

To prevent similar false positives:

1. **Improve Pattern Matching**: Don't flag methods that return `None` as part of legitimate business logic
2. **Add Context Analysis**: Consider the full method implementation, not just the ending pattern
3. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure analysis tools report correct file locations
4. **Test Integration**: Run actual functionality tests, not just static analysis

The method works correctly and should not be modified.
