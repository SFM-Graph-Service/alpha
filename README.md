# sfmToolkit
SFM Toolkit: A Prototype for Implementing the [Social Fabric Matrix Framework](./sfm-overview.md). 

# Overview
This was intended to be used for a grad school project, but ended up as a precursor to the [SFM Suite](./suite/README.md) I am experimenting with. The code example, [sfm-toolkit.py](./sfm-toolkit.py) demonstrates:

- Defining the core data entities: An SFEntity (to represent policies, regulations, etc.) and a Relationship (to connect these entities).

- Building a graph model: Using NetworkX to store and analyze the interconnected relationships.

- Visualization: Rendering a simple diagram with matplotlib to illustrate the matrix of relationships.

- A starting point for simulations: A placeholder function to simulate policy impact changes. 

The included pytyon file is a starting point designed to demonstrate three core capabilities of the SFM framework:

- Mapping Entities and Relationships: By defining abstract classes for SFEntity and Relationship, you can represent any component of an organizationâ€™s policy or institutional ecosystem. Relationships are captured as directed edges with associated properties (like "compliesWith" or "supports") and weights that quantify influence.

- Graph-Based Analysis & Visualization: Using NetworkX, the system builds a directed graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent quantified relationships. Visualization (via matplotlib) aids in understanding the network structure visually.

- Simulation of Policy Changes: The simulate_policy_change() function provides a placeholder to adjust relationship weights. You can enhance this function with more sophisticated algorithms that reflect real-world impacts, ROI analysis, or predictive modeling.
