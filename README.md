# Social Fabric Matrix Graph Service

An experimental Python framework for implementing F. Gregory Hayden's Social Fabric Matrix (SFM) methodology, providing tools for modeling, analyzing, and querying complex socio-economic systems through graph-based data structures.

## Overview

The Social Fabric Matrix Graph Service is an experimental software implementation of the Social Fabric Matrix framework, designed to model and analyze complex interdependencies within socio-economic systems. This framework aspires to enable researchers, policy analysts, and decision-makers to:

- **Model Complex Systems**: Represent actors, institutions, resources, processes, and their relationships in a unified graph structure
- **Analyze Policy Impacts**: Trace the effects of policy changes through interconnected networks
- **Forecast System Changes**: Use network analysis to predict outcomes of interventions
- **Query Complex Relationships**: Perform sophisticated analytical queries on system topology

What started as a graduate school project prototype has evolved into a experimental framework that attempts to implement Hayden's SFM methodology using modern software engineering practices and extensible architecture.

## Key Features

### üìä **Experimental Data Model**

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NetworkX
- NumPy (for advanced calculations)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SFM-Graph-Service.git
cd SFM-Graph-Service

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from core.sfm_models import SFMGraph, Actor, Institution, Relationship
from core.enums import RelationshipKind
from db.sfm_dao import SFMRepositoryFactory
from core.sfm_query import SFMQueryFactory

# Create a repository
repo = SFMRepositoryFactory.create_repository("networkx")

# Create entities
usda = Actor(label="USDA", sector="Government")
farmers = Actor(label="Farmers Association", sector="Agriculture") 
market = Institution(label="Commodity Market")

# Add to repository
repo.create_node(usda)
repo.create_node(farmers)
repo.create_node(market)

# Create relationships
regulation = Relationship(
    source_id=usda.id,
    target_id=farmers.id,
    kind=RelationshipKind.REGULATES,
    weight=0.8
)
repo.create_relationship(regulation)

# Load into SFM graph
sfm_graph = repo.load_graph()

# Create query engine for analysis
query_engine = SFMQueryFactory.create_query_engine(sfm_graph, "networkx")

# Analyze network
central_actors = query_engine.get_most_central_nodes(Actor, "betweenness", 5)
policy_impact = query_engine.analyze_policy_impact(usda.id, impact_radius=3)
```

### Advanced Example: Grain Market Analysis
```python
from examples.us_grain_export_example import create_us_grain_market_graph

# Create experimental grain market model
repo = SFMRepositoryFactory.create_repository("networkx")
sfm_graph = SFMGraph(
    name="US Grain Market Analysis",
    description="experimental model for grain price forecasting"
)

# Build complex graph with entities and relationships
us_grain_graph = create_us_grain_market_graph(repo, sfm_graph)

# Perform sophisticated analysis
query_engine = SFMQueryFactory.create_query_engine(us_grain_graph, "networkx")

# Find system vulnerabilities
vulnerabilities = query_engine.system_vulnerability_analysis()

# Trace resource flows
grain_flows = query_engine.trace_resource_flows(ResourceType.PRODUCED)

# Analyze policy impacts
for policy_id, policy in us_grain_graph.policies.items():
    impact = query_engine.analyze_policy_impact(policy_id, impact_radius=2)
    print(f"{policy.label}: affects {impact.get('total_affected_nodes', 0)} nodes")
```

### Running the Examples
```bash
# From workspace root
python examples/us_grain_export_example.py

# Or using module syntax
python -m examples.us_grain_export_example

# For running from subfolders, examples include path resolution
python examples/us_grain_export_example.py  # Works from any directory
```

2. **Extensibility**: Abstract interfaces allow new storage backends and analysis methods
3. **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures data integrity and developer experience
4. **Performance**: Optimized for both small prototypes and large-scale analysis
5. **Hayden Compliance**: Faithful implementation of SFM theoretical framework

## Data Model

### Entity Hierarchy
The framework models Hayden's core SFM components:

- **Node Types**: Base classes for all system entities
  - `Actor`: Decision-making entities (agencies, firms, individuals)
  - `Institution`: Rule systems at three levels (formal, organizational, informal)
  - `Resource`: Stocks and assets (natural, produced, financial, knowledge)
  - `Process`: Transformation activities
  - `Flow`: Quantified system linkages
  - `Policy`: Specific institutional interventions
  - `Indicator`: Measurable system performance metrics

- **Relationship Types**: Semantic connections between entities
  - Governance relationships (REGULATES, AUTHORIZES, ENFORCES)
  - Economic relationships (FUNDS, TRADES, PRODUCES)
  - Information relationships (INFORMS, INFLUENCES, COMMUNICATES)
  - Process relationships (TRANSFORMS, EXTRACTS, DISTRIBUTES)

### Dimensional Entities

3. **Flow Quantification**: Measurable transfers between system components
4. **Dimensional Analysis**: Temporal, spatial, and scenario slicing
5. **Policy Evaluation**: Systematic assessment of intervention effects

## Development

### Adding New Storage Backends

1. Implement the `SFMRepository` abstract class
2. Add factory method to `SFMRepositoryFactory`

        # Neo4j-specific implementation
        pass
```
