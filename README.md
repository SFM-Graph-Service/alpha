An experimental Python framework implementing F. Gregory Hayden's Social Fabric Matrix (SFM) methodology for modeling, analyzing, and querying complex socio-economic systems through graph-based data structures and sophisticated analysis tools.

## Overview

The Social Fabric Matrix Graph Service is an experimental software implementation of the Social Fabric Matrix framework, designed to model and analyze complex interdependencies within socio-economic systems. This framework enables researchers, policy analysts, and decision-makers to:

- **Model Complex Systems**: Represent actors, institutions, resources, processes, flows, and their relationships in a unified, type-safe graph structure
- **Analyze Policy Impacts**: Trace the effects of policy changes through interconnected networks using advanced graph algorithms
- **Forecast System Changes**: Use network analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate outcomes of interventions
- **Query Complex Relationships**: Perform sophisticated analytical queries on system topology with a powerful query engine
- **Validate System Integrity**: Ensure data consistency through comprehensive enum validation and type safety
- **Visualize Networks**: Generate interactive visualizations for system exploration and presentation

Built with modern software engineering practices, this framework provides a robust, extensible architecture suitable for both research prototyping and production-scale policy analysis applications.

from core.sfm_enums import RelationshipKind, InstitutionLayer
from db.sfm_dao import SFMRepositoryFactory
from core.sfm_query import SFMQueryFactory

market = Institution(label="Commodity Market", layer=InstitutionLayer.FORMAL)

# Add to repository
repo.create_node(usda)
repo.create_node(farmers)
repo.create_node(market)

# Create relationships with validation
regulation = Relationship(
    source_id=usda.id,
    target_id=farmers.id,
    kind=RelationshipKind.REGULATES,
    weight=0.8,

)
repo.create_relationship(regulation)

# Load into SFM graph for analysis
sfm_graph = repo.load_graph()

# Create query engine for analysis
query_engine = SFMQueryFactory.create_query_engine(sfm_graph, "networkx")

# Perform network analysis
central_actors = query_engine.get_most_central_nodes(Actor, "betweenness", 5)
policy_impact = query_engine.analyze_policy_impact(usda.id, impact_radius=3)

print(f"Most central actors: {central_actors}")
print(f"Policy impact: {policy_impact}")
```

### Using the Service Layer
```python

)
service = SFMService(config)

# Use high-level service operations
actor_id = service.create_actor("USDA", "Government")
institution_id = service.create_institution("Market", InstitutionLayer.FORMAL)

# Create relationships through service
service.create_relationship(
    actor_id, institution_id, 
    RelationshipKind.PARTICIPATES_IN, 
    weight=0.9
)

# Get analysis results
analysis = service.get_network_analysis()
