# Social Fabric Matrix Graph Service

An advanced Python framework implementing F. Gregory Hayden's Social Fabric Matrix (SFM) methodology for modeling, analyzing, and querying complex socio-economic systems through graph-based data structures and sophisticated analysis tools.

## Overview

The Social Fabric Matrix Graph Service is a comprehensive software implementation of the Social Fabric Matrix framework, designed to model and analyze complex interdependencies within socio-economic systems. This framework enables researchers, policy analysts, and decision-makers to:

- **Model Complex Systems**: Represent actors, institutions, resources, processes, flows, and their relationships in a unified, type-safe graph structure
- **Analyze Policy Impacts**: Trace the effects of policy changes through interconnected networks using advanced graph algorithms
- **Forecast System Changes**: Use network analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate outcomes of interventions
- **Query Complex Relationships**: Perform sophisticated analytical queries on system topology with a powerful query engine
- **Validate System Integrity**: Ensure data consistency through comprehensive enum validation and type safety
- **Visualize Networks**: Generate interactive visualizations for system exploration and presentation

Built with modern software engineering practices, this framework provides a robust, extensible architecture suitable for both research prototyping and production-scale policy analysis applications.

- Use type hints and docstrings for all public methods
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines with pylint validation

**Testing Requirements:**
- Write unit tests for individual components
- Include integration tests for component interactions
- Add validation tests for new enum types or relationship rules
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify API endpoints with request/response testing

**Documentation Standards:**
- Update relevant README sections for new features
- Add docstrings following Google style conventions
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Maintain theoretical alignment documentation for SFM methodology changes

### Contribution Areas

**High-Priority Contributions Needed:**
- Additional storage backends (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Enhanced visualization capabilities with interactive web components
- Machine learning integration for predictive modeling
- Performance optimizations for large-scale graph analysis
- Industry-specific SFM templates and example models

**Medium-Priority Enhancements:**

### Adding New Storage Backends

1. Implement the `SFMRepository` abstract class in `db/sfm_dao.py`
2. Add factory method to `SFMRepositoryFactory`
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Update documentation and examples

Example for Neo4j backend:
```python
class Neo4jSFMRepository(SFMRepository):
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        """Initialize Neo4j connection."""
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(connection_string)
    
    def create_node(self, node: Node) -> Node:
        """Create node in Neo4j database."""
        # Implementation with Cypher queries
        pass
```

### Adding New Analysis Methods

1. Extend the `SFMQueryEngine` abstract class in `core/sfm_query.py`
2. Implement in `NetworkXSFMQueryEngine` class
3. Add comprehensive tests in `tests/test_sfm_query.py`
4. Document usage patterns and theoretical justification

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from main
2. **Develop**: Implement changes with tests and documentation
3. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass (`python -m unittest discover tests -v`)
4. **Lint**: Run pylint and fix any style issues
5. **Document**: Update README and relevant documentation
6. **Submit**: Create pull request with clear description of changes

### Community Guidelines

- **Be Respectful**: Maintain professional and inclusive communication
- **Academic Rigor**: Ensure theoretical alignment with Hayden's SFM methodology
- **Open Collaboration**: Share knowledge and help other contributors
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize code quality and system reliability over speed
